## Overview

DevMate provides a comprehensive exports API that allows you to integrate DevMate functionality into your own FiveM scripts. This enables you to leverage DevMate's powerful features programmatically.

<Callout type="info">
	This documentation covers the available exports. More detailed examples and use cases will be added as the API expands.
</Callout>

## Available Exports

DevMate exports various functions that can be called from other resources using the FiveM export system. All exports follow the standard FiveM export pattern:

```lua
-- Lua example
local result = exports.DevMate:ExportName(parameters)
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const result = exports.DevMate.ExportName(parameters);
```
