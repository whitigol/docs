## Overview

This guide will walk you through the complete installation process for DevMate, from downloading the resource to configuring permissions and activating your license.

---

<Callout type="warning" title="Prerequisite">
This guide assumes you have already purchased DevMate from Big Daddy Scripts. If you have not, please [purchase it here](https://bigdaddyscripts.com/Products/View/2586/DevMate).
</Callout>

## Step 1: Download DevMate

After purchasing DevMate, head to your [Big Daddy Scripts Account Page](https://bigdaddyscripts.com/Account) and find the order that contains DevMate. Click on the "Download"
button to download the latest version of DevMate.

---

## Step 2: Extract the File

The `.zip` file you downloaded will contain a folder named `DevMate`. Drag and drop this folder into your `resources` folder.

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
	**DO NOT** rename the folder. This will result in DevMate not working correctly.
</Callout>

---

## Step 3: Add the Resource to Server

Navigate to your server's `server.cfg` file and add the following line where you want DevMate to start:

```bash title="server.cfg"
ensure DevMate
```

<Callout type="info">It's recommended to place DevMate near the top of your server.cfg to ensure it loads early, but this is not required.</Callout>

---

## Step 4: Grant Permissions

Navigate to your server's `server.cfg` file and add the following line to grant DevMate the necessary permissions:

```bash title="server.cfg"
add_ace resource.DevMate command allow # DevMate Permissions
```

This permission allows DevMate to execute commands required for its functionality.

---

## Step 5: Insert License Key

From the [Big Daddy Scripts Account Page](https://bigdaddyscripts.com/Account), under "Licenses", find DevMate and click on "VIEW".

![Licenses Section](./img/licenses.png)

At the top of the page, you will find your license key. Click the "COPY" button to copy your license key.

![License Key](./img/copy-key.png)

Then, navigate to your DevMate configuration file (`DevMate/config.json`) and insert your license key into the `LicenseKey` field:

```json title="DevMate/config.json"
{
	"$schema": "...",
	"LicenseKey": "your-license-key-here",
	...
}
```

<Callout type="warning">Make sure to keep your license key secure and never share it publicly. Your license is tied to your account and server.</Callout>

### License Key Troubleshooting

## Step 6: Configure Permissions (Optional)

Before starting your server, you may want to configure the permissions system in DevMate. See the [Configuration](/docs/fivem-scripts/devmate/config) guide for detailed information
on setting up role-based permissions.

<Callout type="info">By default, DevMate will work without additional permission configuration, but setting up proper permissions is highly recommended for security.</Callout>

---

## Done

You have now successfully installed DevMate! Start your server and DevMate will be available for use.
