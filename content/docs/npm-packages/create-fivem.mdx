description: A quick way to bootstrap a FiveM script using TypeScript, JavaScript, or Lua—complete with a pre-configured compiler.
---

## Overview

**`create-fivem`** is a simple CLI tool that scaffolds a new FiveM script with zero setup. It supports TypeScript, JavaScript, and Lua, and comes pre-configured with the
[`@whitigol/fivem-compiler`](/docs/npm-packages/fivem-compiler) for seamless development and deployment.

---

## Features

- <Bs.BsTools className="inline-block mr-1" /> Preconfigured with [`@whitigol/fivem-compiler`](/docs/npm-packages/fivem-compiler)
- <Bs.BsCardList className="inline-block mr-1" /> Choose TypeScript, JavaScript, or Lua
- <Bs.BsFolder2 className="inline-block mr-1" /> Ready-to-use project structure
- <Bs.BsBox className="inline-block mr-1" /> Works with Pnpm, Bun, npm, and Yarn

---

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- A Node.js package manager installed (Pnpm, Bun, npm, or Yarn)

---

## Installation

Run the command using your preferred package manager:

```npm
npm create fivem@latest
```

---

## CLI Prompts

Once the command runs, you’ll be prompted to select:

- Option to initialize a Git repository for version control
- Choose your programming language:
    - TypeScript
    - JavaScript
    - Lua
- Specify the resource details:
    - Name
    - Author
    - Description
    - Version
- Decide whether to include NUI (in-game UI):
    - **If yes:**
        - Select UI framework (React, Vue, or plain HTML)
        - Choose UI language (TypeScript or JavaScript)
    - **If no:**
        - NUI will not be included in the project

## Output Structure

Here’s what a full-featured TypeScript project looks like:

```
PROJECT ROOT/
├─ node_modules/
├─ src/
│  ├─ client/
│  │  └─ index.ts
│  ├─ server/
│  │  └─ index.ts
│  └─ fxmanifest.lua
├─ package.json
├─ ts.wfm
├─ wfm.config.ts
```

Everything is already wired up to work with the compiler—just run `pnpm dev`, `bun dev`, `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`.

---

## Next Steps

After generating your script:

1. Open the project directory.
2. Start the dev server with your package manager (`pnpm dev`, `bun dev`, `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`).
3. Begin scripting immediately—everything is already set up.
