## Overview

The `wfm.config.ts` file powers your FiveM build pipeline. This page explains every available option in detail, with examples and usage tips to help you configure your script with confidence.

You can generate a config file automatically when bootstrapping your project with [`create-fivem`](/docs/npm-packages/create-fivem).

## Default Configuration

Click below to view the full default config file:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title={<>Full Default Config <code className="text-sm font-mono text-muted-foreground bg-muted px-1 rounded-md">wfm.config.ts</code></>}>

```ts title="wfm.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@whitigol/fivem-compiler";

export default defineConfig({
	watch: {
		server: ["src/server/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
		client: ["src/client/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
		all: ["src/data/**/*", "src/stream/**/*"],
	},

	copy: [
		{
			from: "src/stream/**/*",
			to: "stream",
		},
		{
			from: "src/data/**/*",
			to: "data",
		},
	],

	skipCopyDuringWatch: true,
	minify: false,
	obfuscate: false,

	resource: {
		directory: "resource",
	},
});
```

## Runtime Helpers

### `isDev`

You can dynamically modify settings based on the current environment using the `isDev` helper:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Example: Environment-aware config">

```ts title="wfm.config.ts" lineNumbers
import { defineConfig, isDev } from "@whitigol/fivem-compiler";

watch: {
    server: ["src/server/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
    client: ["src/client/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
    all: ["src/data/**/*", "src/stream/**/*"],
},

copy: [
    {
        from: "src/stream/**/*",
        to: "stream",
    },
    {
        from: "src/data/**/*",
        to: "data",
    },
],

skipCopyDuringWatch: true,

// Only minify in production
minify: !isDev, // [!code highlight]

// Obfuscate in development (not recommended)
obfuscate: isDev, // [!code highlight]

resource: {
    directory: "resource",
},
```

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Configuration Reference

Each field below is optional and overrideable. The compiler merges your config with sensible defaults.

---

### `watch`

Defines which files should be watched during development.

```ts
watch: {
  server: ["src/server/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
  client: ["src/client/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"],
  all: ["src/data/**/*", "src/stream/**/*"],
}
```

- `server` – Watch files that only affect the server
- `client` – Watch files that only affect the client
- `all` – Watch shared assets or additional folders

Use flags like `--skip-client` or `--skip-server` to narrow down builds.

---

### `copy`

Specifies files and folders to move from your source tree to the final build.

```ts
copy: [
	{
		from: "src/stream/**/*",
		to: "stream",
	},
	{
		from: "src/data/**/*",
		to: "data",
	},
];
```

- `from` – A relative glob path from the root of your project
- `to` – Destination path within the final resource (no leading `/`!)

You can also rename single files:

```ts
copy: [
	{
		from: "src/special/index.html",
		to: "ui/index.prod.html",
	},
];
```

---

### `skipCopyDuringWatch`

Avoids re-copying files while running in `--watch` mode.

```ts
skipCopyDuringWatch: true;
```

Useful for large folders (e.g. `stream`) that don’t need to be rebuilt frequently.

---

### `minify`

Enables or disables code minification.

```ts
minify: false;
```

<Callout type="warning">Not supported for Lua files. Use with caution, as it may violate FiveM's Terms of Service.</Callout>

---

### `obfuscate`

Enables or disables code obfuscation.

```ts
obfuscate: false;
```

<Callout type="warning">Also unsupported for Lua. Use sparingly—obfuscation may slow down builds and complicate debugging. This may also violate FiveM's Terms of Service.</Callout>

---

### `resource.directory`

Sets the output directory for the compiled resource.

```ts
resource: {
	directory: "resource";
}
```

If the `OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable is set, it overrides this value.

---

### `entry` (Advanced)

Override the default entry points for the server and client.

```ts
entry: {
  server: "src/server/index.*",
  client: "src/client/index.*",
}
```

<Callout type="info">Changing this is generally unnecessary unless you have a non-standard folder structure.</Callout>
