## Creating Configuration Files

### Compiler Configuration

Create a new file named `wfm.config.js` in the root of your project. This file defines how the compiler behaves.

```js title="wfm.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@whitigol/fivem-compiler";

export default defineConfig({
	// Watch for file changes in the specified directories and subdirectories.
	// This configuration allows targeted builds by specifying different scopes: server, client, or all files.
	// Use these options with build flags such as --skip-server or --skip-client for more control.
	watch: {
		server: ["src/server/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"], // Files specific to the server-side codebase
		client: ["src/client/**/*.{lua,ts,js}"], // Files specific to the client-side codebase
		all: ["src/data/**/*", "src/stream/**/*"], // Shared files, including assets and data
	},

	// Define files or folders to copy from the project source to the output destination.
	// Each entry specifies a source path (from) and a destination path (to), relative to the project and output roots.
	//! DO NOT USE A LEADING SLASH — IT WILL BREAK THE BUILD!
	copy: [
		{
			from: "src/stream/**/*", // Directory containing files for FiveM's streaming functionality (e.g., models, textures)
			to: "stream", // Target location in the root of the output directory
		},
		{
			from: "src/data/**/*", // Directory for configuration or supplemental data files
			to: "data", // Target location in the root of the output directory
		},
		/*
        {
            * Single File Example

            from: "src/nested/single-file.txt", // Specify the exact file to copy
            to: "into/any/path/from/resource/root/filename.txt", // Target path including filename

            ? Note: If you change the filename in the "to" path, it will rename the file after moving it.
        },
        */
	],

	// Skips moving files defined in the "copy" option during watch mode.
	// This helps speed up build times in development, especially for large files
	// (e.g., assets in the "stream" folder) that you only want to move during a build.
	skipCopyDuringWatch: true,

	//! WARNING: Minification is discouraged and may violate FiveM's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.
	//* Note: Minification is not supported for Lua files.
	minify: false,

	//! WARNING: Obfuscation is discouraged and may violate FiveM's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.
	//* Note: Obfuscation is not supported for Lua files.
	obfuscate: false, //? Enabling this option may significantly increase build times.

	// Configuration for the output resource directory.
	resource: {
		// Specify the root output directory for the final built resource.
		//* NOTE: If the "OUTPUT_DIR" environment variable is defined, it will override this value.
		//! DO NOT USE A LEADING SLASH — IT WILL BREAK THE BUILD!
		directory: "resource",
	},
});
```

### Language Definition

Create a new file called `js.wfm` in the root of your project. This lets the compiler know you're using JavaScript.

---

## Project Structure

### Project Source Folder

Create a `src` folder in the root of your project. This will be the base for organizing your code.

<Callout type="info">You can name it something else if you prefer, but make sure to update the paths in your configuration file accordingly.</Callout>

### Client and Server Folders

Inside the `src` folder, create two subfolders named `client` and `server`. These folders will contain your client-side and server-side logic, respectively.

### JavaScript Configuration

While you’re using JavaScript, you should still create a `jsconfig.json` file in both the `client` and `server` folders. This helps with type checking, editor tooling, and code
assistance.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Client jsconfig.json">
```js title="client/jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@citizenfx/client", "@whitigol/fivem-compiler/client", "@whitigol/fivem-compiler/common"]
  }
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server jsconfig.json">
```js title="server/jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@citizenfx/server", "@types/node", "@whitigol/fivem-compiler/server", "@whitigol/fivem-compiler/common"]
  }
}
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Index Files

In both the `client` and `server` folders, create an `index.js` file. These will act as the main entry points for your logic.
