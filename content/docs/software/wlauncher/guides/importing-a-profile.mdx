## Importing a Profile

wLauncher allows you to import pre-configured `.wlp` server profiles, making setup quick and easy. You can import these profiles manually through the UI or simply by opening the file directly.

### Manual Import

To import a profile manually:

1. Open **wLauncher**.
2. Click **New Profile**.
3. Select **Import Profile**.
4. Choose the `.wlp` file you want to import.
5. Click **Import Profile** or double-click the file.
6. The profile will now appear on your wLauncher home screen.

<Callout type="info">Manual import is helpful if you want to review your available profiles before selecting one to load.</Callout>

### Automatic Import

If wLauncher is installed, `.wlp` files can be opened directly to import them automatically.

To use automatic import:

1. Download or receive a `.wlp` profile file.
2. Open the file by double-clicking it or selecting “Open with wLauncher.”
3. wLauncher will launch (if not already running) and import the profile in the background.

<Callout type="info">This is the fastest way to get a profile into wLauncher. You don’t even need to open the app manually.</Callout>

## Profile File Behavior

`.wlp` files are encrypted to protect server information and configuration values. Modifying these files is not supported and will result in failure to import.

<Callout type="warn">Do not attempt to edit `.wlp` files manually. Altered files will be treated as corrupted and cannot be imported.</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                           | Suggested Fix                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File doesn't open automatically | Ensure `.wlp` is associated with wLauncher. Try opening from the launcher manually. |
| Error: “Corrupted file”         | Do not edit `.wlp` files. Re-download a clean copy.                                 |
| Nothing happens on import       | Make sure wLauncher is up to date and restart it.                                   |

<Callout type="info">If you're sharing a profile, simply send the `.wlp` file—recipients can import it automatically with no setup required.</Callout>
